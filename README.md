Background:

Weather Py: Prove "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?" (Used Python requests, APIs, and JSON)
Vacation Py: Working with weather data to plan future vacations. (Used jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API)

Weather Py - Conclusions:
1) Max Temperature is higher as we approach the equator. 
2) There is not a significant correlation between cloudiness and latitude
3) Correlation between max temperature and latitude is higher in northern hemisphere than southern hemisphere.
